# Particle_System
This is a particle system built using Java with the processing library. The FlowField branch implements large scale vector fields to steer each individual particle based on each individual velocity vector at that area of approximation. The master branch applies acceleration to each individual particle towards the mouse when left click is held.

I currently working on moving this to the web with the use of WebGL in order to get more performance than just the single core processsing on the CPU allowed with the proccessing library.
